# File-Compression-and-decompression-using-Huffman-Encoding
 File compression usinh Huffman Encoding by converting a binary tree into a Heap data structure. The program takes .8b file. The program will make a frequency table and the compression program should run the Huffman Algorithm and produce the encoding tree. It will use the encoding table and sompress the file.
